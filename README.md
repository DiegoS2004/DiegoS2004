# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Diego Sabillon

I'm a **Computer Science** student at TecnolÃ³gico de Monterrey, passionate about creating efficient, scalable applications and diving deep into **data analysis**. I love working with **Python**, **Node.js**, **MySQL**, and a variety of other tools to solve real-world problems.

My projects range from building full-stack web applications to data-driven solutions, and I'm always on the lookout for new challenges to grow and improve my skills.

I'm always open to collaborating or discussing interesting projects, so feel free to explore my repositories or reach out!
